This repo contains an independent project I completed during my undergraduate degree. 
The Heatmap folder contains part 1, which is introductory and assigns colours to sections of a map based on pollution values.
The Drone folder contains the whole project. A drone navigates a map going between sensors and avoiding going over sensitive buildings. 
It collects readings and assigns colours based on value to each one.

This project was completed in Java, and contains testing files.
